# CIS Slot Filling System 2015

This is the code for the slot filling system of the CIS entry to the TAC KBP Slot Filling shared task in 2015.
It has been developed from 2014-2015.
Several scripts for slot filler classification (multi-class models) are newer (from 2016-2017).

Author: Heike Adel, 2014-2017

---------------------------------------

Prerequisites:

In order to run the slot filling systems, the following software is required:
- Terrier (Version 4.0) [1] -> enter the path to Terrier in doQuery.py
- Stanford CoreNLP [2] (Version "stanford-corenlp-full-2014-01-04") -> enter the path to CoreNLP in doNERandCoref.py and utilities.py
- Scikit Learn (Version 0.17.1)
- Theano (Version 0.8.0.dev0.dev-e088e2a8d81a27c98b2e80b1a05227700996e42d)
- editdist (Version 0.3 from http://www.mindrot.org/files/py-editdist)

Preparation:
- Add the path of Terrier and Stanford CoreNLP to the slot filling system (see above)
- Prepare the documents for indexing with Terrier (some cleaning steps) by running preprocessing/normalizeTexts_forTerrier.py
- Index the preprocessed documents with Terrier (see Terrier commands)
- If you would like to use entity linking with WAT [3], you need to obtain an authorization token at https://sobigdata.d4science.org/web/tagme/wat-api and enter it in modul_entityLinking.py
- adapt the following paths according to your file system:
  - doNerAndCoref.py and readNerAndCoref: TAGGING_PATH: this is where the results from CoreNLP will be stored
  - doQuery.py, run_example.py: TERRIER_DIR: this is the path to the indexed version of the evaluation corpus
  - data/docId2path_corpus2015: PATH_TO_CORPUS: this is the path to the 2015 evaluation corpus
  - eval_CS2015.py: PATH_TO_PATTERNS: this is the path to the patterns by Roth et al. 2013 [4]
---------------------------------------

Running the pipeline:
- The main class to call is Evaluation in eval_CS2015.py
- A sample running script is provided with run_example.py

---------------------------------------

Note:

- For using your own classification models inside the slot filling system, simply adapt modul_candEvaluation.py. 
- Training scripts for CNN and SVM can be found at preprocessing/trainingCNN and preprocessing/trainingSVM, respectively.
  - When using the config files in cnn/configs_X for training the CNNs, the paths for train and dev files need to be adapted
- Classification model weights and output thresholds can be tuned with preprocessing/getWeightsAndThresholds.py
- The CIS entry to SF 2015 used higher thresholds for the second hop results. The corresponding script is postprocessing/doHigherThresholds.py
